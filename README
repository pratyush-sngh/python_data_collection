this repository contain code to:
1 have active tweet collector using tweepy library and storing part of the needed data in mongodb
2 download dom from any site using pattern
3 collecting rrs feeds using pattern

pattern is a very useful library. with lot of integration to social networking sites and searching engine etc.
first tried doing tweet collection also with it. Tweepy being streaming api library was much easier to use
